mdblog - v1.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a Drupal 8 module that provides blogs written using Markdown. It
works using an external Markdown processor command (e.g. kramdown) to generate
the HTML for the blog content node. Both the original Markdown source and the
resulting HTML are stored in a custom node field type in parallel. It was
created by Roger Gee at the Tulsa City-County Library as an educational
exercise. This project is open-source software. You may use it without warranty
or restrictions.

Installation

Install the module in the normal way. Then configure settings in the module
configuration in the Drupal modules admin pages (/admin/config/custom/mdblog).

Settings to configure:

    command-line:
        This controls what command the functionality will use to convert the
        markdown source. For example, if you have kramdown installed with the
        rouge formatter available:

        ruby --external-encoding UTF-8 -S kramdown --syntax-highlighter rouge

    stdin:
        Check the box for standard input if the command you specified receives
        the markdown input via stdin. If this box is *not* checked, then a
        temporary file is created and appended to the command-line. If the token
        @file is found in the command then instead of appending the file name,
        the token @file is replaced with the file name.

    render theme type:
        Provide a custom theme type used to render the blog posts. You may leave
        this empty, but to provide a stylesheet you'll need to write a custom
        module that provides a theme that attaches required libraries.
